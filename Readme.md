This project is a personal project which have for goal to:

1. Solve a sudoku grid with different ways (brut force method, analytic method and using neural networks) to compare them (time performance, ram consumption, ...)

2. Detect and solve sudoku grid in a given picture, with different parameters like the used method, the input format (image path, url, webcam capture, sudoku string (maybe with an interface to enter it easily)), the output format (write result on the image, display it in the standard output ...)

3. Generate solvable grids (grid with only one solution)
 
The sudokus here are only square sudokus the size can be configured in `constante.py`.
